###Joe Maki R Assignment Review

## Loading Data
Seem to go very well no issues

## Data Processing

Looks very good. Everything seem to work correctly. The only recommendation I have is to change the naming of the files to make them seem more logical 

##Visualization

The visualization part was great seems that you did a really great job on that part. I just had difficulty get the second plot to run. I looked at the graphs you posted to GitHub and the graph look good. 

##Overall

Overall, great job. There isn't much I would change or do moving forward. Maybe just change the file names and that would be it.
